# KMeans-Clasutering
Machine Learning Foundation: Coursera Project
Unsupervised MAchine Learning: KMeans Clustering
Purpose: The purpose of this lab exercise is to learn how to use an unsupervised learning algorithm, K-means using sklearn.

At the end of this lab you will be able to:

Run a K-means algorithm.
Understand what parameters are customizable for the algorithm.
Know how to use the inertia curve to determine the optimal number of clusters.
K-Means Overview
K-means is one of the most basic clustering algorithms. It relies on finding cluster centers to group data points based on minimizing the sum of squared errors between each datapoint and its cluster center.
